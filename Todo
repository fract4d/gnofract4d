Orbits/Attractors

A new kind of formula which specifies a per-iteration function or set
of functions from a 4D point to another 4D point. Plot after each
iteration. Initially, ignore Z,W position - later, project to screen.

Or: use same functions, a separate drawing mechanism, plus a flag for
formula to set default. That could allow Buddhabrot-style
calculations on all types.

params (not all applicable to all types): 
1) how to set color of point
2) time step
3) which points to start with

gnofract4d

Gnofract4d server:
Browse formulas, .fct files interactively in web browser, gf4d
gf4d fetch formulas automatically when missing
formulas are versioned, .fct file lists revision it used
local repository with versioning?
anyone can edit any formula, no-one can delete older revisions
all edits are attached to a named user. 
Anyone can create an account without human intervention
Post new formulas and .fct files easily from within GUI
Post thumbnail images for browsing

design possibilities:
use revision control system (subversion, cvs, rcs, arch?)
pysvn (has further dependencies)
hosting: cvsdude? sourceforge?
wiki? (need to remove formatting, though)

Distributed computing: 

Scenario: I have 3 computers at home, want to generate fractals more
quickly. I install gf4d on all 3 of them, then without further
configuration I can use any of the computers to create images and the
others will contribute if available.

Requires: discovery protocol, work distribution scheme that can cope
with missing or misbehaving clients

Scenario: I want to generate a huge animation. I join up to a global
group of gf4d users who contribute spare cycles (via a screensaver?)
in return for a look at what I'm generating, (like ElectricSheep).

Requires: above, +able to deal with ad-hoc networks of thousands of peers,
economic incentive, security, works with NAT
