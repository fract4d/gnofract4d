<p>Modern interface (using the GTK toolkit) with unlimited undo, full-screen mode, simple interaction,
and quick previews. Explorer Mode and AutoZoom help you find interesting parts of the
fractal automatically. Since all formulas are compiled to machine code before being run, you get
snappy calculations even on complex custom formulas. Gnofract 4D will take full advantage of
multi-core computers for even faster rendering.</p>
