<p>What sets it apart from other fractal programs (and makes it &ldquo;4D&rdquo;) is the way that it treats
the Mandelbrot and Julia sets as different views of the same four-dimensional fractal object.
This allows you to create images which are a cross between the two sets and explore their
inter-relationships.</p>
