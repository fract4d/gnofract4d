<span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span>'s screen layout is deliberately simple. Most of the screen is
taken up by a viewport onto the fractal you're investigating. By
default, this is the Mandelbrot set. You can directly click on this to
zoom. The toolbar provides quick access to frequently used functions,
and more complex properties of the fractal are accessed through dialog
boxes brought up via the menu bar.
</p><p>
Initially, just play around - after all, generating fractals isn't
meant to be <span class="emphasis"><em>work</em></span>. If you make a change you don't
like, just hit Undo.
</p><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="basics"></a>Interacting with the Fractal</h3></div></div></div><p>
Each fractal is an infinitely complex image, which you can see a slice
of in the main window. By left-clicking on the window, you can zoom in
to view finer and finer details. Just click on an area you like to
view it more closely. If you click and drag with the left button, you can
draw a white box around an area. When you let go, you zoom in
so that the area inside that box fills the window. 
</p><p>
To zoom back out, click with the right button. You can also press
<span class="keycap"><strong>Home</strong></span> to return all parameters to the starting point
for this fractal, <span class="keycap"><strong>Control</strong></span>+<span class="keycap"><strong>Home</strong></span> to
reset the zoom only, or use <span class="guibutton">Undo</span> to go back one
step.  There isn't a click and drag feature for the right button.
</p><p>
Clicking with the middle button rotates the view by 90 degrees in the
<span class="emphasis"><em>xz</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>yw</em></span> axes. If you're
currently looking at the Mandelbrot set, you'll get a Julia set, and
vice versa. If you're looking at something else, you'll get something
weird. Note that clicking this twice doesn't take you back to where
you started: the screen also gets recentered on the point you clicked,
so clicking twice will normally give you a perturbed, deformed-looking
Mandelbrot.
</p><p>
The cursor keys pan around the image. Hold down
<span class="keycap"><strong>Control</strong></span>+ <span class="keycap"><strong>&lt;cursor&gt;</strong></span> to move more
quickly. Hold down <span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span> +
<span class="keycap"><strong>&lt;cursor&gt;</strong></span> to move around in the other two
dimensions, mutating the image. You can recenter the image on a point
by left-clicking on that point while holding down
<span class="keycap"><strong>Shift</strong></span>.  </p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Non-4D formulas</h3><p> Some fractal formulas
(typically those originally written for Fractint or UltraFractal)
don't support full 4D operation. (<span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> determines this by whether
the formula uses the <code class="varname">#zwpixel</code> variable.) In this
case, the widgets for rotating in other dimensions, warping, and the
middle mouse button will be disabled.  </p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="files"></a>Working with Files</h3></div></div></div><p>

<span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> uses several different types of file. These have different
purposes as listed in the table below.

</p><div class="informaltable"><table class="informaltable" border="1"><colgroup><col /><col /><col /></colgroup><thead><tr><th>File Type</th><th>Extensions</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>
Parameter File
</td><td><code class="filename">.fct</code></td><td>

A parameter file is a small text file which contains all the settings
required to produce a particular image, such as the position of the
viewer along the X axis and the coloring scheme used. The parameter
file lists the formula used, but doesn't contain the entire formula,
so if you invent a new formula and want to share parameter files which
use it, you need to distribute the formula file as well.

<span class="application">Fractint</span> uses <code class="filename">.par</code> files for
this purpose and <span class="application">UltraFractal</span> uses <code class="filename">.upr</code>. 
Unfortunately <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> can't read
those formats (yet).
</td></tr><tr><td>
Image File
</td><td>
<code class="filename">.jpg</code>,
<code class="filename">.png</code>
</td><td>
<span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> supports JPEG and PNG file formats for image
output. <span class="emphasis"><em>No information about the fractal parameters is
stored in the image file</em></span>, so if you want to carry on
exploring from a particular point you need to save a parameter file as
well. <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> can't load image files, only save them. Choose
<span class="guimenu">File</span> &gt; <span xmlns="" class="guimenuitem"><span xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" class="guimenuitem">Save Image</span></span> to
save an image.
I recommend
using PNG images for high quality output, and JPEGs only when image
size is important, because JPEGs introduce artifacts which blur the
fine details of your fractal.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Formula File
</td><td>
<code class="filename">.frm</code>,
<code class="filename">.ufm</code>
</td><td>

A formula file is a collection of formulas, each of which is a
description of the algorithm used to draw a particular kind of
fractal, expressed in a simple programming language (see <a class="xref" href="formref.html" title="Formula Language Reference">the section called “Formula Language Reference”</a> for language details). Both <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> and <span class="application">Fractint</span>
use <code class="filename">.frm</code> as the extension, and
<span class="application">UltraFractal</span> uses <code class="filename">.ufm</code>. In
general, any formula which works in <span class="application">Fractint</span> should work in <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span>
and any which works in <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> should work in <span class="application">UltraFractal</span>, but the
reverse is not true. 

</td></tr><tr><td>
Coloring Algorithm File
</td><td>
<code class="filename">.cfrm</code>,
<code class="filename">.ucl</code>
</td><td>

A coloring algorithm file is a collection of formulas used to assign
colors to a fractal. <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> combines a coloring algorithm with a
formula to produce the final image (this approach is shared with
<span class="application">UltraFractal</span> - <span class="application">Fractint</span> restricts you to built-in coloring
algorithms).  Coloring algorithms are written in the same language as
fractal formulas. <span class="application">UltraFractal</span> uses the extension .ucl for its
coloring algorithm files. Some of these are compatible with <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> but
so far not very many.
</td></tr><tr><td>
Gradient File
</td><td>
<code class="filename">.map</code>,
<code class="filename">.ggr</code>
<code class="filename">.ugr</code>
</td><td>

A gradient file is a list of colors which is used to translate the
purely numerical output of the formula into something pretty to look
at. Gradients are currently saved only inside the fractal itself, not
as separate files. The GIMP uses the extension .ggr for its gradient
files; <span class="application">Fractint</span> uses .map for its own, simpler files. <span class="application">UltraFractal</span>
uses .ugr - these files contain multiple gradients.

fractal by zooming in repeatedly, each time choosing the quadrant of
the screen which has the largest number of different colors (with some
randomization as well). You can start it going, go off for a coffee,
and see what it's found when you return, or guide it by clicking on
parts you like as it goes. It'll stop when the image reaches the
minimum size, which is set by default to stop just before you get to
the limits of the precision <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> offers.
</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="explorer"></a>Explorer</h4></div></div></div><p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>Explorer</em></span> helps you find neat-looking fractals
easily. It divides the screen into a large central section and smaller
"subfractals" which surround it. The central section is the main image
- you can click on this to zoom in, change the color, or perform any
operation you can normally. The other images around the edges are
"mutant" versions of the main image - they're formed by starting with
the base parameters and randomly changing them a bit. Whenever you
change the main image, you get a whole new set of mutants. If you like
a mutant more than the main picture, click on it to move it to the
middle - it then becomes the main picture and you get 12 new mutants
based on the new main image. When you're satisfied with the results,
click the Explorer button again to return to normal mode.  </p><p> The Shape and Color sliders on the toolbar determines how
different the mutants are from the standard image. If Shape's set to
100, they're almost unrecognizable - if it's 0, they're exactly the
same. Similarly if Color's 100, each mutant is a different color, and
0 keeps the colors all the same.  </p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="browser"></a>Formula Browser</h4></div></div></div><p>

The <span class="emphasis"><em>Formula Browser</em></span> allows you to look at all the
fractal formulas, coloring functions and gradients which are currently loaded
formula files. When you select a formula (from the Formula list in the
middle), the source window shows you the contents of that formula. You
can then use <span class="guibutton">Apply</span> to change the current
fractal to use that formula. This also resets the formula's parameters
to their defaults. Alternatively, <span class="guibutton">OK</span> applies
the formula and closes the window.  </p><p>
Tips: 
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p> To load a new formula file, choose <span class="guimenu">File</span>

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="director"></a>Director</h4></div></div></div><p>

The <span class="emphasis"><em>Director</em></span> allows you to create fractal movies.
You first define keyframes (including base keyframes) which are stops
in video.  Then, for each of them, you define for how long they last
(<span class="guilabel">duration</span> - in frames), how long still image of
keyframe will stay in video (<span class="guilabel">stopped for</span>) and
interpolation type between several possibilities. When you hit
<span class="guibutton">Render</span> button, Director will render all frames
and put them in directory you selected and then it will try to create
a video using <a class="ulink" href="https://www.ffmpeg.org/" target="_top">
<span class="emphasis"><em>FFmpeg</em></span></a>.</p><p>
Tips:
</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>
In order to end up with a video file, not just a bunch of images, you need to have
<span class="emphasis"><em>ffmpeg</em></span> compiled with support for zlib and libvpx.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>
You can always save your animation configuration for later use.
</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>

</p></div><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="painter"></a>Painter</h4></div></div></div><p>

The painter dialog allows you to change the colors of your fractal by
clicking on the place where you want the color to be different. First,
select the color you want in the color selector. Then click on the
image - the part of the gradient most responsible for the color of
that pixel will be updated with the color you chose. Toggle the
"painting" button off if you want to interact with the fractal while
the painter dialog is up.

</p></div></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="toolbar"></a>Toolbar buttons</h3></div></div></div><p>
On the left of the toolbar you can see a small preview window, which
updates as you change the angle or position buttons, to give you an
idea of what the fractal will look like when you release the button.
</p><p>
The first eight toolbar buttons correspond to the ten parameters which
define the view. The circular angle buttons, labelled
<span class="emphasis"><em>xy</em></span> to <span class="emphasis"><em>zw</em></span>, correspond to
rotation around the principal planes in four dimensions. They can
changed by dragging the dot around. When you let go, the fractal will
update. By the way, the <span class="emphasis"><em>zw</em></span> angle does work, you
just can't see its effects until you rotate in some other dimensions
first.  </p><p>
The square position buttons, <span class="emphasis"><em>pan</em></span> and
<span class="emphasis"><em>wrp</em></span> (aka Warp), can be used to alter the view. The
<span class="emphasis"><em>pan</em></span> button allows you to pan around the current
view. The <span class="emphasis"><em>wrp</em></span> button allows you to move along the
other two axes, resulting in a mutated version of the current image.
Click inside one then drag the mouse, watching the preview window
update, then release the mouse when you like the results.  </p><p>The warp menu allows even formulas which weren't designed to be
used with <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> to be used in 4D mode. If the current fractal has any
complex parameters, they're listed in this menu. If you select one,
that parameter's value is set to the value of the Z and W coordinates
for each pixel. Basically what this means is that the parameter you choose
becomes the fourth dimension. NB: If you set an explicit value for the parameter as
well, it'll be ignored.
</p><p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>Deepen</em></span> button allows you to increase the current iteration count
and tighten the periodicity checking, for those occasions when the
auto-deepening and/or auto-tolerance doesn't get it right. This will
generally convert some 'inside' pixels to outside and make the image
look better, at the cost of longer rendering time. The image size list should be
self-explanatory. If you want a size not listed here, use the
Preferences dialog. </p><p> The <span class="emphasis"><em>Undo</em></span> and
<span class="emphasis"><em>Redo</em></span> buttons should be fairly obvious. You can
undo as many times as you like. Note that undo also affects parameters
such as color, not just position on screen.  Lastly, the
<span class="emphasis"><em>Explore</em></span> button toggles Explorer Mode. See <a class="xref" href="using.html#explorer" title="Explorer">the section called “Explorer”</a>.</p></div><div class="sect2"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a id="preferences"></a>Changing Fractal Settings</h3></div></div></div><p> In <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span>, settings are divided into <span class="emphasis"><em>Fractal
Settings</em></span>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Gradients</em></span> and
<span class="emphasis"><em>Preferences</em></span>. <span class="emphasis"><em>Fractal
Settings</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>Gradients</em></span> are saved in the
fractal's .fct file - they are properties of the fractal itself. By
contrast, <span class="emphasis"><em> Preferences</em></span> are your preferences for
<span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span>'s general behavior and are saved in <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span>'s config file
(~/.gnofract4d), so they will still be active next time you
start <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> </p><div class="sect3"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a id="settingsdialog"></a>Fractal Settings</h4></div></div></div><p>

The <span class="emphasis"><em>Formula</em></span> section allows you to choose the
formula used to calculate the fractal, and to set any parameters the
formula has. You can modify the formula by choosing <span class="guibutton">Browse
</span>, which invokes the Formula Browser. <span class="emphasis"><em>Max
Iterations</em></span> sets the number of iterations a point will go
through before we give up and assume it's a member of the
Julibrot. The other parameters on this pane are different depending on
the fractal type.
</p><p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>Outer</em></span> page controls the function used to
decide what color to draw those points which aren't part of the
fractal set proper. Similarly, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Inner</em></span> page
controls the function used for points which are part of the set.
</p><p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>Location</em></span> entryboxes allow you to
change the coordinates of the screen center and the image size. 

The <span class="emphasis"><em>Angles</em></span> entryboxes allows you to set the rotation
angles. Only values between 0 and 2 * pi are different; values outside
this range "wrap" to points inside that range.
</p><p>

The <span class="emphasis"><em>Transforms</em></span> page allows you to control a list
of transformations applied to the image, and any parameters those transforms have.
</p><p>
The <span class="emphasis"><em>General</em></span> page gives a few options which don't
fit anywhere else. <span class="emphasis"><em>Flip Y Axis</em></span> causes Y to
increase top-to-bottom, rather than
bottom-to-top. <span class="emphasis"><em>Periodicity Checking</em></span> is a method
to speed up generation of the fractal. Points inside the fractal
eventually settle into a loop, where they repeatedly jump around
between the same points (they become 'periodic'). By noticing this, we
can skip calculating the point any further. You will generally want to
disable this if you are coloring the inside of the fractal, since it
will look rather weird otherwise. <span class="emphasis"><em>Tolerance</em></span> is
the distance between points which we'll accept as being 'the same' for
the purposes of periodicity detection. This is automatically adjusted
if the 'auto tolerance' setting in the preferences is enabled.

</p><p>

The <span class="emphasis"><em>Colors</em></span> tab allows you to edit the list of
colors used to display your fractal. For more complex gradient
editing, you can also use the GIMP's gradient editor.

the size of the image in pixels. If <span class="emphasis"><em>Maintain Aspect
Ratio</em></span> is checked when you change either the width or
height, the other automatically changes to keep the image the same
shape. If <span class="emphasis"><em>Auto Deepen</em></span> is enabled, <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> will try
to automatically guess how many iterations are required to display the
image correctly. Similarly, <span class="emphasis"><em>Auto Tolerance</em></span>
adjusts the periodicity tolerance setting to try and calculate the
image quickly but correctly. <span class="emphasis"><em>Antialiasing</em></span> makes
the image look smoother but takes extra time to do. The difference
between 'fast' and 'best' is that fast antialiasing doesn't bother to
recalculate points which are the same color as their neighbors. This
speeds things up a lot but can miss a few details sometimes. </p></div><div class="sect4"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h5 class="title"><a id="prefs_compiler"></a>Compiler</h5></div></div></div><p>
<span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> needs a C compiler to be available at runtime in order to work
(it dynamically creates the code to compute a particular formula when
you select it). The <span class="emphasis"><em>Compiler</em></span> page allows you to
specify a location for the compiler and options to pass to
it. <span class="emphasis"><em>If <span class="application">Gnofract 4D</span> is working fine, generally I suggest you leave
