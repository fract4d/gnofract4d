A collection of about 25,000 Fractint formula files by many authors,
originally compiled by George C. Martin and currently maintained by
Paul N. Lee. Many can be used with Gnofract 4D.

Thousands of Fractint .map (gradient) files, providing more coloring options.

<a href="http://www.colorschemer.com/schemes/">Yet Even More Gradients</a> 
</td>
<td >
A website listing a large number of simple color schemes, mostly aimed
at web designers. Gnofract 4D can load the ".cs" color schemes listed
there.

<a href="http://exoteric.roach.org/">Blatte's Fractal Pages</a> 
</td>
<td >

A website with some great fractal images (NB: not generated with Gnofract
4D, though). The original source of the 'blatte' gradient files.

<a href="http://www.crackerjack.net/time_passes/">Time Passes</a></td>
<td > A script by Tyler Macdonald which uses Gnofract 4D to create
animations, and some cool example animations using it. Gnofract 4D now
has built-in support for creating animations, but this might still be
useful to you.

The grandaddy of all free fractal programs. Gnofract 4D borrows many
ideas and features from Fractint.

<a href="http://www.ultrafractal.com">UltraFractal</a>
</td>

<td >
If you're using Windows, this is the fractal program you
want. Gnofract 4D again has many concepts (such as the formula
language and coloring algorithms) in common with UltraFractal. Note
that it's shareware, not open source.
