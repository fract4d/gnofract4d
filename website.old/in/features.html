</a>
<b>Unlimited variety.</b> Most fractal programs provide a
fixed set of formulas. Gnofract 4D's formula compiler allows
you to use any function you can think of. It also supports
Fractint and UltraFractal formulas and coloring algorithms so you can
use the many thousands of formulas written for those packages.
Take a look at the <a
href="gallery.html" title="Some pictures produced by Gnofract 4D">
Gallery</a> for some examples.

<b>Innumerable options.</b> Each base fractal can be displayed in millions of
ways, using many coloring algorithms, including old favorites like
biomorph, powerful options like Orbit Traps, and unique methods like
Hot and Cold. Display multiple fixed points, critical values, or
other regions using the "fate" option.

<b>Easy-to-use interface. </b> Modern interface (using the GTK
toolkit) with unlimited undo, full-screen mode, simple interaction,
and quick previews. Click <a href="screenshots.html"

</p>

<p>
<b>Fast calculations.</b>Since all formulas are compiled to machine
code before being run, you get snappy calculations even on complex
custom formulas. If you have a multi-processor, hyperthreaded, or
multi-core computer, Gnofract 4D will take full advantage of it for
even faster calculations.

<b>Four dimensions.</b>  
What sets it apart from other fractal programs (and makes it "4D") is
the way that it treats the Mandelbrot and Julia sets as different
views of the same four-dimensional fractal object. This allows you to
create images which are a cross between the two sets and explore
their inter-relationships. If you'd like to know some more about the
maths, you can find details in the user's manual.

<p>
<b>High quality output.</b> 24-bit color rendering, coloring methods
for smooth gradients, antialiasing, and no limit on output
size. The images below show the difference - the first is generated by

Fractint</a>, the second by Gnofract 4D.

<b>Find cool images quickly and share them with other users.</b>
Explorer Mode and AutoZoom help you find interesting parts of the
fractal automatically. You can post the results to the <a
href="http://flickr.com/groups/gnofract4d/pool">user gallery</a> on
the web directly from the program.  
</p>

<p>
<b>Popular and widely used.</b> Over <b>30,000</b> downloads to
date. Actively developed, with over 20 releases over the past 7
years. Currently the most popular fractal program listed on <a
href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/gnofract4d/">freshmeat.net</a>. 
Included in FreeBSD ports tree and Fedora Extras.

<b>Linux Format magazine said: </b>"Hot Pick!... lovely crisp rendering... the
abundance of alternative colour schemes is superb... great fun to just
play around with."
