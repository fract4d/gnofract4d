<b>Q:</b> How do I run Gnofract 4D on Mac OS X?

<b>Q:</b> When I try to install the Gnofract 4D RPM on
Mandrake, Mandriva or SuSE, why do I get this message? <br/> 

<code class="q"> 
error: Failed dependencies: 
        pygtk2 &gt;= 1.99 is needed by gnofract4d-2.13-1
</code>

</p>

<p>

<b>A:</b> Gnofract 4D needs PyGTK installed as a prerequisite. All these
distributions provide a suitable version by default. Unfortunately
they all use different names for it: Fedora uses "pygtk2", Mandrake
uses "pygtk2.0", and SuSE uses "python-gtk". The RPMs I've built use
the Fedora name, so they don't realize that all the packages they need
are present on these distributions. The workaround is to run:</p>
<p>
<code>rpm -i <b>--nodeps</b> &lt;rpmfile&gt;</code>. 
</p>
<p>
Alternatively you could download
the source package or even volunteer to repackage Gnofract 4D for your
distribution.

Q: When I try to compile Gnofract 4D on SuSE Linux, why do I get this error?<br/>

<pre class="q">
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./setup.py", line 4, in ?
    from distutils.core import setup, Extension
ImportError: No module named distutils.core
</pre>
</p>

<p>

<b>A:</b>SuSE splits the distutils module into a separate package
which is not installed by default. Personally I think that's a really
bad idea, but c'est la vie. To compile Gnofract 4D successfully on
SuSE linux, you must have these packages installed beyond the
defaults:
<ul>
<li>python-devel</li>
<li>gtk2-devel</li>
<li>gconf2-devel</li>
<li>libpng-devel</li>
<li>libjpeg-devel</li>
<li>gcc</li>
<li>gcc-c++</li>
</ul>

Install those using YaST then try compiling again.

Q: When I try to compile older versions of Gnofract 4D on Ubuntu, why do I get this error?<br/>

<pre class="q">
Can't set up. Error running 'pkg-config gconf-2.0 --cflags'.
Package gconf-2.0 was not found in the pkg-config search path.
Perhaps you should add the directory containing `gconf-2.0.pc'
to the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable
No package 'gconf-2.0' found
Possibly you don't have one of these installed: 'gconf-2.0'.
</pre>
</p>

<p>

<b>A:</b>You need to install the libgconf2-dev package, which is
required to build programs which use gconf. Newer versions will still
compile if you don't have gconf2-devel, but they will be unable to 
pick up your browser settings from gconf.

Q: When I try to compile Gnofract 4D, why do I get this error?<br/>

<pre class="q">cc: error trying to exec 'cc1plus': execvp: No such file or directory
error: command 'gcc' failed with exit status 1
</pre>
</p>

<p>

<b>A:</b>You have the C compiler installed, but not the C++
compiler. You need to install the g++ (sometimes called gcc-c++)
package, which is required to build C++ programs.
</p>

<h2>Runtime Issues</h2>

<p class="q">
Q: When I try to load a parameter file, why do I get an error 'Can't
find formula file foo.frm in formula search path'?
</p>

<p>

<b>A:</b>That parameter file uses a formula or coloring method which
isn't included in the standard set shipped with Gnofract 4D. Try
downloading the formula from the <a
href="http://formulas.ultrafractal.com">UltraFractal Public Formula
Database</a>.
</p>

<p class="q">
Q: When I zoom in far enough, the image turns all pixelated and blocky. Why is that?
</p>

<p>
<b>A:</b>You've reached the limit of the precision supplied by your
processor's built-in math chip, I'm afraid. On Intel architectures
this will be when the image size is around 10^-13. The numbers
representing different pixels are so close together that it can't tell
the difference. You'll have to zoom out again.
